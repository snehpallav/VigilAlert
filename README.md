**VigilAlert** is an android application which will be used as an **“emergency notification system”**
To notify all the users in nearby region in case there is any disaster or calamity.  Users who witness any 
Incident or disaster will have an **option** to report the same in the app, and support with photos, if possible.

# Technology used
* Android will be used as a platform to build the app.
* Image processing will be used to validate correct images.
* Database will be used to keep track of all the users.
* Location based API will be used to keep track of the users.

# how does it work
* In vigilAlert, users will have to register using their email id and phone number (so as to avoid fake reports).
* Users will have an option to report any disaster, and support with photos, if possible.
* The report will trigger a notification (an alarm) in all the active devices in the affected area, in a certain radius.
* Any nearby police station, or NDRF and other rescue teams will be given admin access, along with the reported incident.
* All nearby active devices will be notified with an alarm until the user marks him safe.
* If the alarm rings for more than 1 minute, the person will be marked unsafe, and live data of all the devices will be updated every few seconds.
* Devices which were last active in the target area (and are currently inactive) will be sent a text message and if they don’t respond within 5 minutes, they will be marked unsafe.
* This will help the rescue teams, and police to effectively plan their rescue operation and save more lives.

# economical
* The map will involve varied density of people to be rescued. The rescue team will only send the required number of volunteers for the same. Hence, it   will be economical and also reduce the waste of manpower.

# Prediction
* This will also help in predicting any disaster by fetching data from weather API, and notify the same.
Apart from that, the app will also warn users of any possible calamity,

* For e.g. in a recent  kedarnath incident, one side of the mountain, there was heavy rain, people who were on the other side were not aware and lost their lives due to the dam overflow.

* If users report any possibility of any unforeseen happening, if a dam is about to be opened, the users in the region will get notified and will be alert,
Hence, will save more lives.

# additional features
* Language translator for reaching variety of users.
